This project is used to deal with two main tasks:
First one is that I use mathematical ways and python programming language to handle ridge regression in the machine learning(the codes are in the first file)
The second one is that I use gradient descent methods to handle ridge regression in the machine learning(using python programming), and the codes are in the second file.

Noticeï¼š the project assignment is from the Coursera class (machine learning) which was conducted by University of Washington (Seattle).
